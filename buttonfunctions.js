                In June 1520, the Aztecs drove Hernan Cortes and the Spanish conquistadores out of the capital city of Tenochitlan. As the Spanish fled, they took with them vast amounts of Aztecan gold and treasure, much of which was lost during their escape in the depths of the Tenochitlan waterways.
